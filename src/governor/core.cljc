  "The itonami actor pattern's governor layer, written once.

  Every actor in this workspace seals its intelligence into one node that may
  only *propose*, and puts an independent Governor between that proposal and
  any write, disclosure, filing, payment or authentication (CLAUDE.md Actors
  section, ADR-2607011000). The domain rules differ completely between
  actors — a GTIN allocator checks a check digit, a law firm checks 利益相反,
  a formation agent checks a sanctions list. **The verdict assembly around
  those rules does not differ, and it was copied by hand into 376
  repositories.**

  Measured 2026-07-30 across those 376 `governor.cljc` files:

    * 346 assemble the verdict with the same five-line shape, differing only
      in the local name of the escalation trigger (`always-risky?` ×146,
      `risky-op?` ×107, `stakes?` ×13, `escalating-op?` ×9, …).
    * 365 declare `confidence-floor` as `0.6`; 5 use `0.4`, 5 use `0.7`.
    * **1 has drifted.** `cloud-itonami-isco-5419` computes
      `:escalate? (or hard? low? escalating-op?)` where every sibling computes
      `(and (not hard?) (or low? escalating-op?))`.

  That last one is the reason this library exists rather than a style guide.
  The drift is not exploitable through the standard graph — the router tests
  `:hard?` first, so the operation still lands in `:hold` — but the verdict it
  hands to every *other* reader is wrong: a console, an approval queue or a
  report that trusts `:escalate?` will show a permanently-refused operation as
  awaiting sign-off, and invite a human to try to approve something that can
  never be approved. This is the same failure mode CLAUDE.md already records
  for `cacao.clj` (copied into ~25 repos with a \"keep in sync\" comment, then
  actually diverged) and for `langchain-store`'s codec (copied
  complete-identical into 190). A hand-copied invariant is not an invariant.

  ## Four dialects. Three cannot drift, and one has no escalation on purpose

  Surveyed 2026-07-30; every one of the 376 is accounted for:

  * **boolean** (345) — `{:ok? :hard? :escalate?}`, three independent flags.
    The only dialect that *can* drift, because nothing in the shape stops two
    flags from contradicting each other, and the only one that *did*
    (isco-5419). Use `verdict` + `conformance-failures`.
  * **enum** (24) — `{:decision :proceed|:hold|:human-approval}`, one value.
    A verdict cannot say both 「permanently refused」 and 「awaiting sign-off」
    because there is only one slot. Use `decision`.
  * **flag-enum** (1, `network-awai/cloud-itonami`) — a kernel where the
    disposition is one flag value compared with `eq-flag`. Same property as
    the enum; not served by this library and does not need to be.
  * **publication** (6 — `animeka-actor`, `dougaka-actor`, `kouhou`,
    `tashikame`, `com-etzhayyim-minidrama`, `com-etzhayyim-tomoshibi`) —
    `{:ok? :violations :warnings}`, binary, **and deliberately no escalation
    path at all**. Use `publication-verdict`.

  New actors that gate an *operation* should prefer the enum.
  `verdict->decision` and `decision->verdict` translate, so a console can
  consume either.

  ### The publication dialect is not a missing escalation. Do not repair it.

  These six publish speech, and their own source says why a per-post human
  approval step is refused: `tashikame.phase` calls it 「per-post prior
  restraint」, and `tomoshibi.governor` states the governor 「is NOT an
  external operator/Council prior restraint — it is tomoshibi's OWN seed rail
  (the off-switch is the revocable member CACAO leash, not a per-post
  approval)」. Publication is autonomous by default (ADR-2606281500); the
  control is revoking the publishing capability once, not a human clearing
  each post.

  The shape follows from that: HARD violation → hold and never publish;
  everything else → publish. Low confidence is a **`:warnings` entry that
  becomes a transparency tag on the published item**, not a gate — which is
  also why five of the six set `confidence-floor` to 0.4 rather than 0.6, and
  why `tomoshibi` carries no confidence at all (it gates on `:gate-result`).
  None of that is drift. An audit that mechanically repaired these toward the
  boolean dialect would be adding prior restraint to a speech actor, which is
  the failure this note exists to prevent.

  ## The missing-confidence default

  Both constructors treat an absent `:confidence` as **0.0**, never 1.0.

  This is worth stating because the fleet does not agree with itself. All 346
  boolean actors default to 0.0 and one of them tests it explicitly — a
  proposal with no :confidence key at all is treated as 0.0 confidence, never
  silently treated as trustworthy. All 24 enum actors default to **1.0** —
  and `cloud-itonami-isco-4321`'s own advisor docstring says the opposite of
  what its governor does — its advisor docstring reads: LLM parse failures
  always yield :confidence 0.0 (never fabricate confidence), which forces the
  governor to escalate/hold.

  A proposal that does not say how confident it is has not said it is
  confident. Defaulting to 1.0 means an omission auto-proceeds, which is the
  one direction a governor must never fail in.

  ## What belongs here, and what does not

  **Here:** the verdict arithmetic, the routing decision derived from it, the
  four provenance checks whose logic is genuinely identical everywhere, and a
  conformance check an actor's own test suite can call to prove its verdict is
  well-formed.

  **Not here:** domain rules, store protocols, detail wording. Each actor's
  `:detail` strings are user-facing text in that actor's language and idiom,
  and its Store is its own — so every function below takes the record or value
  already read, never a store, and every rule keyword and detail string can be
  overridden. This library holds no ambient authority: it reads nothing,
  writes nothing, and calls nothing.

  ## Migration

  Adopt incrementally, on the next occasion you touch a governor — never as a
  fleet-wide rewrite (CLAUDE.md: \"触るついでに漸進移行\"). The smallest useful
  adoption is one line:

  ```clojure
  ;; before
  {:ok? (and (not hard?) (not low?) (not always-risky?))
   :violations hard :confidence conf :hard? hard?
   :escalate? (and (not hard?) (or low? always-risky?))}

  ;; after
  (gov/verdict {:violations hard :confidence conf :escalating-op? always-risky?})
  ```")
